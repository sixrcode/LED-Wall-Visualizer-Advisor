# **App Name**: LED Wall Visualizer Advisor

## Core Features:

- AI Tool Recommender: Uses the Gemini API to recommend and rank open-source/free tools based on event type, tech constraints, and desired inputs, without manual updates. Uses reasoning to filter the output based on the latest cost information, and availability of features, acting as a decision-making tool.
- Interactive Setup Wizard: Provides a step-by-step setup wizard with a checklist that persists progress, guiding users through audio routing, resolution matching, color testing, and performance testing.
- Live-Preview Sandbox: Offers a live preview sandbox that streams mic/line-in via the Web Audio API and embeds visualizers (like Butterchurn or p5.js sketches) for quick proof-of-concept. Includes a full-screen “LED feed” mode.
- Knowledge Cards: Delivers knowledge cards with Markdown cheat-sheets on color contrast, camera placement, and LED safety.
- Offline PDF Export: Generates a one-click "Run-of-Show" PDF summarizing the chosen tool, settings, and a fallback plan.
